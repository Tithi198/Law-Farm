        <div class="term">
            <h3>Accounting Period</h3>
            <p>An accounting period is a timeframe covered in a financial statement, often spanning one or more days, months, or years. If you have ever generated a report in <strong>QuickBooks for property management</strong> or similar accounting software to check your income, costs, or other details, you will notice that each report is based on a specific accounting period.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Accounts Payable</h3>
            <p>Accounts payable is the amount of money your business owes to vendors. It typically involves payments for products or services that you use to operate your business, like the bill for a contractor fixing a property.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Account Receivable</h3>
            <p>This is the money you are currently owed for your services. It includes any outstanding invoices, unpaid fees, or rent balances.</p>
        </div>
        
   <!-- Add more terms here as needed -->

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Accrual Accounting Method</h3>
            <p>This <strong>property management accounting</strong> method records transactions based on the date they occur, regardless of when the payment is made or received. It is mandatory for any business with employees to use this accounting approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Asset</h3>
            <p>An asset is something owned by the business that holds value. The most apparent examples are the properties owned, but it can also encompass cash deposits, land, and the money owed to you (accounts receivable).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Bank Reconciliation</h3>
            <p>It is important to regularly verify that your general ledger aligns with the actual balance stated in your business bank accounts. This verification process is known as bank reconciliation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Bookkeeping</h3>
            <p><strong>Bookkeeping in property management</strong> is essentially the same as business accounting; it involves recording the transactions that form the basis of your business’s accounting data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Cash Accounting Method</h3>
            <p>The cash accounting method logs transactions when they are paid or when payment is received, depending on whether you’re settling a bill or getting paid by a tenant. This method is commonly used by sole proprietors, especially in the early stages of managing their accounts. However, it is important to note that businesses with employees are mandated to use the accrual accounting method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Depreciation</h3>
            <p>Depreciation is a way to measure how the value of an asset decreases over time. For instance, if you buy construction equipment for property development, its value will go down each year due to different factors. Keeping track of the actual depreciation numbers is important, as it might be eligible for tax deductions, depending on the item.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Equity</h3>
            <p>Equity represents the value or ownership stake in the business. If you’re the owner, your equity is calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Expense</h3>
            <p>Expenses represent the costs incurred in the operation of a business. Like depreciation, they impact the overall financial health of your company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Financial Statement</h3>
            <p>A financial statement is not a single document; rather, it encompasses any report providing information about the financial well-being of a business. Examples include balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and income statements. When a lender or auditor requests financial statements, they usually specify the particular report they require.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>General Ledger</h3>
            <p>Your general ledger (GL) is a comprehensive log of all your business transactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Liability</h3>
            <p>A liability is a debt or obligation that a company owes. Examples of liabilities include accounts payable, mortgages, payroll obligations, and loans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h3>Revenue</h3>
            <p>Revenue is the income earned by your business during a specific period. For instance, if you’re a landlord and receive payment from a tenant (or if you’re a property management company and receive payment from a landlord), that amount is considered revenue.</p>

            <h2>Determine Your Accounting Needs</h2>
            <p>Evaluate the complexity and size of your property management business first. This will help you decide the appropriate level of accounting system needed. If you handle just a few properties and transactions, a simple spreadsheet or basic <strong>accounting</strong> software might be enough. However, for larger operations, think about investing in specialized <strong>property management accounting</strong> expert.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Choose Your Accounting Method</h2>
            <p>There are two main property management accounting methods:</p>
            <h3>Cash Basis Accounting</h3>
            <p>In cash-based accounting, you record transactions as soon as money is received or sent, whether for your services, property sales, or contractor payments.</p>
            <p>For example, if a tenant pays you $1,500 rent for September, you would enter that amount in your accounting program right away. This method is straightforward and intuitive, making it a common choice for sole proprietors. However, it might change when you have employees on payroll.</p>
            <h3>Accrual Accounting</h3>
            <p>With the accrual accounting method, transactions are recorded when they occur. If a tenant pays rent for the month, you record that transaction in that month. However, if a tenant pays several months upfront, you would only enter this month’s rent as a transaction, even if the funds are already in your bank account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Choose Accounting Service</h2>
            <p>Select <strong>property management accounting services</strong> that cater to your specific needs. Look for software with features like rent tracking, expense management, reporting, and integration with tools such as tenant portals and online payment systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Set Up Individual Property Accounts</h2>
            <p>Create separate accounts for each property managed using your accounting software. This allows for the tracking of income, expenses, and other financial details unique to each property.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Establish a Chart of Accounts</h2>
            <p>Develop a chart of accounts to categorize financial transactions effectively. This organization ensures accurate record-keeping and simplifies the reporting process, encompassing categories like revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Implement Rent Roll Management</h2>
            <p>Create a rent roll, a spreadsheet tracking rental income for each property and tenant. Include details like tenant names, rental amounts, lease terms, and payment history to monitor rent payments and identify any delinquencies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Automate Rent Collection and Invoice Payments</h2>
            <p>Leverage your accounting software to automate rent collection and invoice payments. Set up online payment options for tenants, streamlining the process and ensuring timely payments, reducing manual effort, and minimizing errors.</p>
